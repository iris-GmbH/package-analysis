    \  HEREUNDER.\n\nStatement of Purpose\n\nThe laws of most jurisdictions throughout\
    \ the world automatically confer\nexclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined\
    \ below) upon the creator\nand subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\"\
    ) of an original work of\nauthorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\").\n\n\
    Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for\nthe\
    \ purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and\nscientific works\
    \ (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and without fear\nof later claims\
    \ of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other\nworks, reuse and redistribute\
    \ as freely as possible in any form whatsoever\nand for any purposes, including\
    \ without limitation commercial purposes.\nThese owners may contribute to the\

    \ creative, cultural and scientific\nworks, or to gain reputation or greater distribution\
    \ for their Work in\npart through the use and efforts of others.\n\nFor these\
    \ and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any\nexpectation of additional\
    \ consideration or compensation, the person\nassociating CC0 with a Work (the\
    \ \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she\nis an owner of Copyright and Related\
    \ Rights in the Work, voluntarily\nelects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly\
    \ distribute the Work under its\nterms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright\
    \ and Related Rights in the\nWork and the meaning and intended legal effect of\
    \ CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available\
    \ under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"\
    Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are\
    \ not\nlimited to, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute,\
    \ perform, display,\n     communicate, and translate a Work;\n ii. moral rights\
    \ retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\niii. publicity and\
    \ privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or\n     likeness depicted in\
    \ a Work;\n iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n\

    \ the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data\n     in a Work;\n vi.\

    \ equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the\n     world based on applicable\
    \ law or treaty, and any national\n     implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver.\
    \ To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\nof, applicable\
    \ law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,\nirrevocably and unconditionally\
    \ waives, abandons, and surrenders all of\nAffirmer's Copyright and Related Rights\
    \ and associated claims and causes\nof action, whether now known or unknown (including\
    \ existing as well as\nfuture claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in\
    \ all territories\nworldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable\
    \ law or\ntreaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future\n\
    medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,\nincluding\
    \ without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional\npurposes (the \"\
    Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each\nmember of the public\
    \ at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and\nsuccessors, fully intending\
    \ that such Waiver shall not be subject to\nrevocation, rescission, cancellation,\
    \ termination, or any other legal or\nequitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment\
    \ of the Work by the public\nas contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of\
    \ Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any\
    \ reason\nbe judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then\
    \ the\nWaiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into\n\
    account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the\nextent the\
    \ Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected\nperson a royalty-free,\
    \ non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\nirrevocable and unconditional\
    \ license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and\nRelated Rights in the Work (i)\
    \ in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\nmaximum duration provided by applicable\

    \ medium and for any number\nof copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including\
    \ without\nlimitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the\n\"\
    License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was\napplied\
    \ by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any\nreason be judged\
    \ legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such\npartial invalidity\
    \ or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder\nof the License, and in\
    \ such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she\nwill not (i) exercise any\
    \ of his or her remaining Copyright and Related\nRights in the Work or (ii) assert\
    \ any associated claims and causes of\naction with respect to the Work, in either\
    \ case contrary to Affirmer's\nexpress Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations\
    \ and Disclaimers.\n\n a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,\
    \ abandoned,\n    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n\
    \ b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or\n    warranties\
    \ of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,\n    statutory or otherwise,\
    \ including without limitation warranties of\n    title, merchantability, fitness\
    \ for a particular purpose, non\n    infringement, or the absence of latent or\
    \ other defects, accuracy, or\n    the present or absence of errors, whether or\
    \ not discoverable, all to\n    the greatest extent permissible under applicable\
    \ law.\n c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n\
    \    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n    limitation\
    \ any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n    Further, Affirmer\
    \ disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n    consents, permissions\
    \ or other rights required for any use of the\n    Work.\n d. Affirmer understands\

    \ in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.\n\n3. Distribution\
    \ Obligations.\n\n     3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You\
    \ create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License,\
    \ including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered\
    \ Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version\
    \ of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this\
    \ License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer\
    \ or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the\
    \ applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However,\
    \ You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described\
    \ in Section 3.5.\n\n     3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which\
    \ You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code\
    \ form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable\
    \ version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom\
    \ you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic\
    \ Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months\
    \ after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after\
    \ a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available\
    \ to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version\
    \ remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained\
    \ by a third party.\n\n     3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause\
    \ all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes\
    \ You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include\
    \ a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly,\
    \ from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name\
    \ of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\
    \ Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin\
    \ or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n\
    \n          (a) Third Party Claims\n          If Contributor has knowledge that\
    \ a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to\
    \ exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor\
    \ must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL\"\
    \ which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail\
    \ that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge\
    \ after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor\
    \ shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available\
    \ thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing\
    \ lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the\
    \ Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n          (b) Contributor\
    \ APIs\n          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming\
    \ interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably\
    \ necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information\
    \ in the LEGAL file.\n\n          (c) Representations.\n          Contributor\
    \ represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (a) above, Contributor\
    \ believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s)\
    \ and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this\
    \ License.\n\n     3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit\
    \ A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice\
    \ in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include\
    \ such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would\
    \ be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)\
    \ You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.\
    \ You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code\
    \ where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered\
    \ Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity\
    \ or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However,\
    \ You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer\
    \ or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,\
    \ support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You\
    \ hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\
    \ liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result\
    \ of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n     3.6. Distribution\
    \ of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only\
    \ if the requirements of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met for\
    \ that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code\
    \ version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including\
    \ a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section\
    \ 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable\
    \ version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'\
    \ rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version\
    \ of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\
    \ contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance\
    \ with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version\
    \ does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code\
    \ version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable\
    \ version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any\
    \ terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\
    \ Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer\
    \ and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or\
    \ such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n\n     3.7. Larger\
    \ Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\
    \ not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as\
    \ a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this\
    \ License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to\
    \ Statute or Regulation.\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of\
    \ the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due\
    \ to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the\
    \ terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations\
    \ and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file\
    \ described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the\
    \ Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such\
    \ description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill\
    \ to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Application of this License.\nThis License\
    \ applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit\
    \ A and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.\n\n     6.1. New\
    \ Versions\n     Netscape Communications Corporation (\"Netscape\") may publish\
    \ revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will\
    \ be given a distinguishing version number.\n\n     6.2. Effect of New Versions\n\
    \     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License,\
    \ You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also\
    \ choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of\
    \ the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right\
    \ to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\n\
    \n     6.3. Derivative Works\n     If You create or use a modified version of\
    \ this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not\
    \ already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license\
    \ so that the phrases \"Mozilla\", \"MOZILLAPL\", \"MOZPL\", \"Netscape\", \"\
    MPL\", \"NPL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license\
    \ (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise\
    \ make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from\
    \ the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name\
    \ of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described\
    \ in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\
    \n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN\
    \ \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\
    \ INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,\
    \ MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK\
    \ AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY\
    \ COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER\
    \ OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR\
    \ OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF\
    \ THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER\
    \ THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. Termination\n\n     8.1. This License and the rights\
    \ granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms\
    \ herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the\
    \ breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\
    \ survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature,\
    \ must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n\
    \n     8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim\
    \ (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor\
    \ (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred\
    \ to as \"Participant\") alleging that:\n\n          a. such Participant's Contributor\
    \ Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights\
    \ granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\
    \ shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless\
    \ if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to\
    \ pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future\
    \ use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation\
    \ claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within\
    \ 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually\
    \ agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn,\
    \ the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically\
    \ terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\n \
    \         b. any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\
    \ Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights\
    \ granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked\
    \ effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made,\
    \ Modifications made by that Participant.\n\n     8.3. If You assert a patent\
    \ infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor\
    \ Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved\
    \ (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement\
    \ litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant\
    \ under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount\
    \ or value of any payment or license.\n\n     8.4. In the event of termination\
    \ under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding\
    \ distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor\
    \ hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF\
    \ LIABILITY\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING\
    \ NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER\
    \ CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH\
    \ PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL\
    \ DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF\
    \ GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\
    \ COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF\
    \ THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY\
    \ TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE\
    \ TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO\
    \ NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,\
    \ SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. government\
    \ end users\nThe Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined\
    \ in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer software\"\
    \ and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such terms are used in\
    \ 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.\
    \ 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire\
    \ Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\n\n11. Miscellaneous\n\
    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.\
    \ If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision\
    \ shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This\
    \ License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent\
    \ applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.\
    \ With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an\
    \ entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America,\
    \ any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction\
    \ of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying\
    \ in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs,\
    \ including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and\
    \ expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for\
    \ the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation\
    \ which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the\
    \ drafter shall not apply to this License.\n\n12. Responsibility for claims\n\
    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for\
    \ claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of\
    \ rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors\
    \ to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended\
    \ or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n13. Multiple-licensed\
    \ code\nInitial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as \"Multiple-Licensed\"\
    . \"Multiple-Licensed\" means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize\
    \ portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the MPL or the alternative\
    \ licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in\

    \ about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\
    \ strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n\
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.\
    \ Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom\
    \ to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish);\
    \ that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change\
    \ the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed\
    \ that you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions\
    \ that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender\
    \ these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you\
    \ if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\nFor example,\
    \ if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must\
    \ give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that\
    \ they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the\
    \ library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they\
    \ can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\
    \ it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect\
    \ your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we\
    \ offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\
    \ and/or modify the library.\n\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it\
    \ very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library\
    \ is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what\
    \ they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation\
    \ will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\n\nFinally,\
    \ software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program.\
    \ We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of\
    \ a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore,\
    \ we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must\
    \ be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\nMost\
    \ GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General\
    \ Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies\
    \ to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General\
    \ Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit\
    \ linking those libraries into non-free programs.\n\nWhen a program is linked\
    \ with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination\
    \ of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original\
    \ library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking\
    \ only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General\
    \ Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.\n\
    \nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less\
    \ to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also\
    \ provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing\
    \ non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General\
    \ Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages\
    \ in certain special circumstances.\n\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may\
    \ be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library,\
    \ so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must\
    \ be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does\
    \ the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little\
    \ to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser\
    \ General Public License.\n\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library\
    \ in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body\
    \ of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free\
    \ programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as\
    \ well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\n\nAlthough the Lesser\
    \ General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure\
    \ that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and\
    \ the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.\n\
    \nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the\
    \ library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived\
    \ from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order\
    \ to run.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\
    \n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which\
    \ contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying\
    \ it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License\
    \ (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nA\
    \ \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so\
    \ as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those\
    \ functions and data) to form executables.\n\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to\
    \ any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms.\
    \ A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work\
    \ under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion\
    \ of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly\
    \ into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation\
    \ in the term \"modification\".)\n\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred\
    \ form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source\
    \ code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\
    \ interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and\
    \ installation of the library.\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution\
    \ and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.\
    \ The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output\
    \ from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\
    \ on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing\
    \ it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program\
    \ that uses the Library does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies\
    \ of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided\
    \ that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\
    \ copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that\
    \ refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy\
    \ of this License along with the Library.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical\
    \ act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection\
    \ in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library\
    \ or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\
    \ distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided\
    \ that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n     a) The modified work must\
    \ itself be a software library.\n\n     b) You must cause the files modified to\
    \ carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any\
    \ change.\n\n     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\
    \ charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n     d) If a\
    \ facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to\
    \ be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as\
    \ an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith\
    \ effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function\
    \ or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose\
    \ remains meaningful.\n\n(For example, a function in a library to compute square\
    \ roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.\
    \ Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or\
    \ table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply\
    \ it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements\
    \ apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work\
    \ are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent\
    \ and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply\
    \ to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute\
    \ the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the\
    \ distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions\
    \ for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part\
    \ regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to\
    \ claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,\
    \ the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative\
    \ or collective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of\
    \ another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based\
    \ on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\
    \ the other work under the scope of this License.\n\n3. You may opt to apply the\
    \ terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to\
    \ a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that\
    \ refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public\
    \ License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version\
    \ 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\
    \ that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\n\
    \nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy,\
    \ so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies\
    \ and derivative works made from that copy.\n\nThis option is useful when you\
    \ wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\n\
    \n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,\
    \ under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections\
    \ 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding\
    \ machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\
    \ 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\nIf distribution\
    \ of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then\
    \ offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies\
    \ the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are\
    \ not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n5. A program\
    \ that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to\
    \ work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work\
    \ that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work\
    \ of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\nHowever,\
    \ linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable\
    \ that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library),\
    \ rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered\
    \ by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\
    \nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that\
    \ is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work\
    \ of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially\
    \ significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is\
    \ itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined\
    \ by law.\n\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure\
    \ layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines\
    \ or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless\
    \ of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object\
    \ code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n\nOtherwise,\
    \ if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code\
    \ for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work\
    \ also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the\
    \ Library itself.\n\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine\
    \ or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work\
    \ containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of\
    \ your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the\
    \ customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\
    \nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is\
    \ used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You\
    \ must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright\
    \ notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as\
    \ well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you\
    \ must do one of these things:\n\n     a) Accompany the work with the complete\
    \ corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\
    \ changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and\
    \ 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the\
    \ complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or\
    \ source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce\
    \ a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that\
    \ the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not\
    \ necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\n\
    \n     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.\
    \ A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library\
    \ already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions\
    \ into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of\
    \ the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible\
    \ with the version that the work was made with.\n\n     c) Accompany the work\
    \ with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user\
    \ the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the\
    \ cost of performing this distribution.\n\n     d) If distribution of the work\
    \ is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent\
    \ access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\n\n     e)\
    \ Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that\
    \ you have already sent this user a copy.\n\nFor an executable, the required form\
    \ of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs\
    \ needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,\
    \ the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed\
    \ (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,\
    \ and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that\
    \ component itself accompanies the executable.\n\nIt may happen that this requirement\
    \ contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do\
    \ not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you\
    \ cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\n\
    \n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side\
    \ in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this\
    \ License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate\
    \ distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities\
    \ is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n     a)\
    \ Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,\
    \ uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under\
    \ the terms of the Sections above.\n\n     b) Give prominent notice with the combined\
    \ library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\
    \ where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n8. You may\
    \ not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as\
    \ expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\
    \ sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\
    \ copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\
    \ terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n9. You are\
    \ not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,\
    \ nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its\
    \ derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this\
    \ License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based\
    \ on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\
    \ all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library\
    \ or works based on it.\n\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any\
    \ work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from\
    \ the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject\
    \ to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on\
    \ the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible\
    \ for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n11. If, as a\
    \ consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for\
    \ any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you\
    \ (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions\
    \ of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.\
    \ If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under\
    \ this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\
    \ may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would\
    \ not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive\
    \ copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy\
    \ both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the\
    \ Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable\
    \ under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\
    \ apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\
    \nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents\
    \ or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\
    \ section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\
    \ distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people\
    \ have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through\
    \ that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to\
    \ the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through\
    \ any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is\
    \ intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the\
    \ rest of this License.\n\n12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is\
    \ restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,\
    \ the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may\
    \ add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\
    \ so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.\
    \ In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the\
    \ body of this License.\n\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised\
    \ and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\
    \ Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\
    \ differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given\
    \ a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of\
    \ this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option\
    \ of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later\
    \ version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify\
    \ a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free\
    \ Software Foundation.\n\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library\
    \ into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with\
    \ these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted\
    \ by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\
    \ make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving\
    \ the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the\
    \ sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY\
    \ IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT\
    \ PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\
    \ HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\
    \ OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\
    \ IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\
    \ THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.\
    \ SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\
    \ REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR\
    \ AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\
    \ AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\
    \ INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\
    \ OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO\
    \ LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR\
    \ THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE),\
    \ EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\
    \ DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your\
    \ New Libraries\n\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the\
    \ greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\
    \ everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution\
    \ under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General\
    \ Public License).\n\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the\
    \ library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\
    \ effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\
    \ the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n\
    \     one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.\n     Copyright\
    \ (C) year  name of author\n\n     This library is free software; you can redistribute\
    \ it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License\
    \ as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License,\
    \ or (at your option) any later version.\n\n     This library is distributed in\
    \ the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the\
    \ implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See\
    \ the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n     You should have\
    \ received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library;\
    \ if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth\
    \ Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA Also add information on how to contact you\
    \ by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work\
    \ as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\"\
    \ for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne,\

    \ \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other\
    \ pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement\
    \ of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or\
    \ performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which\

    ) will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\n\n     b.\
    \ \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias\
    \ and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or\
    \ subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason\
    \ of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual\
    \ creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form\
    \ along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent\
    \ works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A\
    \ work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as\
    \ defined below) for the purposes of this License.\n\n     c. \"Creative Commons\
    \ Compatible License\" means a license that is listed at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses\
    \ that has been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to\
    \ this License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms\
    \ that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this\
    \ License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of works\
    \ made available under that license under this License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction\
    \ license with the same License Elements as this License.\n\n     d. \"Distribute\"\
    \ means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or\
    \ Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.\n\n\
    \     e. \"License Elements\" means the following high-level license attributes\
    \ as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution,\
    \ ShareAlike.\n\n     f. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity\
    \ or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\n\n    \
    \ g. \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the\
    \ individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual\
    \ or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case\
    \ of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons\
    \ who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary\
    \ or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram\
    \ the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of\
    \ a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization\
    \ that transmits the broadcast.\n\n     h. \"Work\" means the literary and/or\
    \ artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation\
    \ any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may\
    \ be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,\
    \ pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the\
    \ same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment\
    \ in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic\
    \ work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;\

    \ it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or\
    \ circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or\
    \ artistic work.\n\n     i. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights\
    \ under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License\
    \ with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor\
    \ to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n\n    \
    \ j. \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and\
    \ to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process,\
    \ including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make\
    \ available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access\
    \ these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform\
    \ the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the\
    \ public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance;\
    \ to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or\

    \ including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of\
    \ fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected\
    \ performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.\n\n2. Fair\
    \ Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict\
    \ any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions\
    \ that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright\
    \ law or other applicable laws.\n\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and\
    \ conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\
    \ non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license\
    \ to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n\n     a. to Reproduce\
    \ the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce\
    \ the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\n\n     b. to create and Reproduce\
    \ Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in\
    \ any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise\
    \ identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation\
    \ could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\"\
    \ or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";\n\
    \n     c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated\
    \ in Collections; and,\n\n     d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n\
    \n     e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n          i. Non-waivable Compulsory\
    \ License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties\
    \ through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor\
    \ reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\
    \ of the rights granted under this License;\n\n          ii. Waivable Compulsory\
    \ License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties\
    \ through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor\
    \ waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\
    \ of the rights granted under this License; and,\n\n          iii. Voluntary License\
    \ Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually\
    \ or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that\
    \ administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise\
    \ by You of the rights granted under this License.\n\nThe above rights may be\
    \ exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The\
    \ above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically\
    \ necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section\
    \ 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n\n\
    4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject\
    \ to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n     a. You may Distribute\
    \ or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must\
    \ include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License\
    \ with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not\
    \ offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License\
    \ or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to\
    \ that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work.\
    \ You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer\
    \ of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.\
    \ When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective\
    \ technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient\
    \ of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under\
    \ the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated\
    \ in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work\
    \ itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,\
    \ upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from\
    \ the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You\
    \ create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\
    \ practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c),\
    \ as requested.\n\n     b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation\
    \ only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License\
    \ with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction\
    \ license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License\
    \ Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative\
    \ Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses\
    \ mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license\
    \ the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii)\
    \ or (iii) (the \"Applicable License\"), you must comply with the terms of the\
    \ Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include\
    \ a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation\
    \ You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms\
    \ on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability\
    \ of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient\
    \ under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices\
    \ that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with\
    \ every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly\
    \ Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may\
    \ not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict\
    \ the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights\
    \ granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section\
    \ 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does\
    \ not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject\
    \ to the terms of the Applicable License.\n\n     c. If You Distribute, or Publicly\
    \ Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request\
    \ has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for\
    \ the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)\
    \ the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or\
    \ if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,\
    \ a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution\
    \ Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable\
    \ means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied;\
    \ (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies\
    \ to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright\
    \ notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection\
    \ 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work\
    \ in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\"\
    \ or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required\
    \ by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,\
    \ however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit\
    \ will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection\
    \ appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent\
    \ as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt,\
    \ You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution\
    \ in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License,\
    \ You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship\
    \ or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties,\
    \ as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express\
    \ prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution\
    \ Parties.\n\n     d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or\
    \ as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute\
    \ or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations\
    \ or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory\
    \ action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's\
    \ honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan),\
    \ in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the\
    \ right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification\
    \ or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation,\
    \ the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the\
    \ fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably\
    \ exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)\
    \ but not otherwise.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS\
    \ OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE\
    \ WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING\
    \ THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\
    \ WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT,\
    \ OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE\
    \ OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\
    \ EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n\
    6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN\
    \ NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,\
    \ INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS\
    \ LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY\
    \ OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n     a. This License and the rights granted\
    \ hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of\
    \ this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections\
    \ from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated\
    \ provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.\
    \ Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n\
    \n     b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here\
    \ is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding\
    \ the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license\
    \ terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any\
    \ such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license\
    \ that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License),\
    \ and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\
    \ stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly\
    \ Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license\
    \ to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under\
    \ this License.\n\n     b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,\
    \ Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same\
    \ terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n\n \
    \    c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\
    \ law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of\
    \ the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this\
    \ agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary\
    \ to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n     d. No term or provision\
    \ of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such\
    \ waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged\
    \ with such waiver or consent.\n\n     e. This License constitutes the entire\
    \ agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There\
    \ are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work\
    \ not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions\
    \ that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified\
    \ without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\n     f. The\
    \ rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were\
    \ drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection\
    \ of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome\
    \ Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances\
    \ and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised\
    \ on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant\
    \ jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according\
    \ to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions\
    \ in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under\
    \ applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License,\
    \ such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License\
    \ is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\n\
    \nCreative Commons Notice\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License,\
    \ and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons\
    \ will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever,\
    \ including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential\
    \ damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing\
    \ two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the\
    \ Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\n\
    Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed\
    \ under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party\
    \ of the trademark \"Creative Commons\" or any related trademark or logo of Creative\
    \ Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted\
    \ use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage\
    \ guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon\
    \ request from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, this trademark restriction\
    \ does not form part of the License.\n\nCreative Commons may be contacted at http://creativecommons.org/.\n\
