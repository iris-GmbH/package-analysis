    \ (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston,\
    \ MA 02110-1301 USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\
    \ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe\
    \ license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the mercy\
    \ of those companies. By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee\
    \ your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is\
    \ free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software\
    \ Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using\
    \ it. You can use it for your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software,\
    \ we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public License\
    \ is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies\
    \ of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,\
    \ that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and\
    \ that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to\
    \ make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you\
    \ to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities\
    \ for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor\
    \ example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for\
    \ a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make\
    \ sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them\
    \ their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,\
    \ and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\
    \ and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours,\
    \ we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty\
    \ for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed\
    \ on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,\
    \ so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'\
    \ reputations.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\
    \ modification follow.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR\
    \ COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n   0. This License Agreement applies\
    \ to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright\
    \ holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.\
    \ The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based\
    \ on the Program\" means either the Program or any work containing the Program\
    \ or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is\
    \ addressed as \"you\".\n\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of\
    \ the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\
    \ conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\
    \ this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any\
    \ other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along\
    \ with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring\
    \ a copy.\n\n   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\
    \ of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph\
    \ 1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n\n      a) cause the modified\
    \ files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the\
    \ date of any change; and\n\n      b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute\
    \ or publish, that in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof,\
    \ either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third\
    \ parties under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may\
    \ choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).\n\
    \n      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\
    \ run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the\
    \ simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an\
    \ appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else,\
    \ saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program\
    \ under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General\
    \ Public License.\n\n      d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring\
    \ a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for\
    \ a fee.\n\n   Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or\
    \ its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\
    \ the other work under the scope of these terms.\n\n   3. You may copy and distribute\
    \ the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object\
    \ code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided\
    \ that you also do one of the following:\n\n      a) accompany it with the complete\
    \ corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under\
    \ the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n      b) accompany it with a written\
    \ offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party free (except\
    \ for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable\
    \ copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\
    \ Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n      c) accompany it with the information\
    \ you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained. (This\
    \ alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received\
    \ the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n\n   Source code for\
    \ a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.\
    \ For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all\
    \ modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source\
    \ code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system\
    \ on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions\
    \ files that accompany that operating system.\n\n   4. You may not copy, modify,\
    \ sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided\
    \ under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,\
    \ distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\
    \ your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have\
    \ received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public\
    \ License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain\
    \ in full compliance.\n\n   5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license\
    \ to do so, and all its terms and conditions.\n\n   6. Each time you redistribute\
    \ the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically\
    \ receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify\
    \ the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\
    \ restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\n \
    \  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\
    \ the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar\
    \ in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\
    \ or concerns.\n\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If\
    \ the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and\
    \ \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\
    \ either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license,\
    \ you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\
    \n   8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\
    \ whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\
    \ permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\
    \ write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\
    \ Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\
    \ all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse\
    \ of software generally.\n\n   NO WARRANTY\n\n   9.\n\n   BECAUSE THE PROGRAM\
    \ IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT\
    \ PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\
    \ HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\
    \ OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\
    \ IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\
    \ THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.\
    \ SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\
    \ REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW\
    \ OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY\
    \ MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\
    \ FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\
    \ ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\
    \ TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU\
    \ OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\
    \ EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\
    \ DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAppendix: How to Apply These Terms to\
    \ Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of\
    \ the greatest possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make\
    \ it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\
    \nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach\
    \ them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion\
    \ of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\
    \ pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n<one line to give the program's\
    \ name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n\nCopyright (C) 19yy <name of author>\n\
    \nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\
    \ the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software\
    \ Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis\
    \ program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;\
    \ without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\
    \ PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should\
    \ have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program;\
    \ if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge,\
    \ MA 02139, USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and\
    \ paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice\
    \ like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\nGnomovision version 69,\
    \ Copyright (C) 19xx name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY;\
    \ for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute\
    \ it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical\
    \ commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General\
    \ Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other\
    \ than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever\
    \ suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)\
    \ or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program,\
    \ if necessary. Here a sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims\

    \ (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\n51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston,\
    \ MA 02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim\
    \ copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n[This is\
    \ the first released version of the library GPL. It is numbered 2 because it goes\
    \ with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software\
    \ are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast,\
    \ the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share\
    \ and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\
    \nThis license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially\
    \ designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose\
    \ authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.\n\nWhen we\
    \ speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General\
    \ Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute\
    \ copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you\
    \ receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software\
    \ or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these\
    \ things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\
    \ anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\
    \ restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute\
    \ copies of the library, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute\
    \ copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients\
    \ all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive\
    \ or can get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must\
    \ provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\
    \ with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And\
    \ you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nOur method of protecting\
    \ your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this\
    \ license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the\
    \ library.\n\nAlso, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\
    \ that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If\
    \ the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients\
    \ to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems\
    \ introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\
    \nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish\
    \ to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually\
    \ obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary\
    \ software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed\
    \ for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nMost GNU software, including\
    \ some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which\
    \ was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public\
    \ License, applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different\
    \ from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything\
    \ in it is the same as in the ordinary license.\n\nThe reason we have a separate\
    \ public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually\
    \ make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a\
    \ program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply\
    \ using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application\
    \ program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined\
    \ work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public\
    \ License treats it as such.\n\nBecause of this blurred distinction, using the\
    \ ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\
    \ sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that\
    \ weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n\nHowever, unrestricted linking\
    \ of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit\
    \ from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public\
    \ License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries,\
    \ while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\
    \ libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this\
    \ as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes\
    \ in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to\
    \ faster development of free libraries.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for\
    \ copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference\
    \ between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\"\
    . The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works\
    \ together with the library.\n\nNote that it is possible for a library to be covered\
    \ by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one.\n\n\
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n   0. This\
    \ License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed\
    \ by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed\
    \ under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called \"this License\"\
    ). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n   A \"library\" means a collection\
    \ of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with\
    \ application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\
    \n   The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which\
    \ has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means\
    \ either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say,\
    \ a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications\
    \ and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation\
    \ is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n   \"Source\
    \ code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications\
    \ to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all\
    \ modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the\
    \ scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\n\n   Activities\
    \ other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License;\
    \ they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is\
    \ not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents\
    \ constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library\
    \ in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library\
    \ does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n   1. You may copy\
    \ and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you\
    \ receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\
    \ publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;\
    \ keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of\
    \ any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\n\
    \n   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you\
    \ may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n   2.\
    \ You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus\
    \ forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications\
    \ or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all\
    \ of these conditions:\n\n      a) The modified work must itself be a software\
    \ library.\n\n      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\
    \ stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n      c) You\
    \ must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties\
    \ under the terms of this License.\n\n      d) If a facility in the modified Library\
    \ refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program\
    \ that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is\
    \ invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event\
    \ an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates,\
    \ and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n      (For\
    \ example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that\
    \ is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection\
    \ 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function\
    \ must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function\
    \ must still compute square roots.)\n\n   These requirements apply to the modified\
    \ work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from\
    \ the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works\
    \ in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections\
    \ when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same\
    \ sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution\
    \ of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other\
    \ licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless\
    \ of who wrote it.\n\n   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights\
    \ or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is\
    \ to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective\
    \ works based on the Library.\n\n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work\
    \ not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library)\
    \ on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work\
    \ under the scope of this License.\n\n   3. You may opt to apply the terms of\
    \ the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy\
    \ of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this\
    \ License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version\
    \ 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary\
    \ GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead\
    \ if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\n\n   Once this\
    \ change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary\
    \ GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works\
    \ made from that copy.\n\n   This option is useful when you wish to copy part\
    \ of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n   4. You\
    \ may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under\
    \ Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\
    \ 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\
    \ source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\
    \ on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n   If distribution\
    \ of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then\
    \ offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies\
    \ the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are\
    \ not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n   5. A program\
    \ that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to\
    \ work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work\
    \ that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work\
    \ of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n \
    \  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates\
    \ an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions\
    \ of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable\
    \ is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution\
    \ of such executables.\n\n   When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material\
    \ from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work\
    \ may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\
    \ Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without\
    \ the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be\
    \ true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n   If such an object file uses only\
    \ numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros\
    \ and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the\
    \ object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\
    \ work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library\
    \ will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative\
    \ of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms\
    \ of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\
    \ whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n   6. As\
    \ an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a \"work that\
    \ uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of\
    \ the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that\
    \ the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\
    \ engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n   You must give prominent\
    \ notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the\
    \ Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this\
    \ License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include\
    \ the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing\
    \ the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\n\
    \n      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable\
    \ source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work\
    \ (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is\
    \ an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"\
    work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user\
    \ can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing\
    \ the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents\
    \ of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile\
    \ the application to use the modified definitions.)\n\n      b) Accompany the\
    \ work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same\
    \ user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than\
    \ the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n      c) If distribution of the\
    \ work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent\
    \ access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\n\n      d)\
    \ Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that\
    \ you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n   For an executable, the required\
    \ form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility\
    \ programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special\
    \ exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\
    \ distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,\
    \ kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless\
    \ that component itself accompanies the executable.\n\n   It may happen that this\
    \ requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries\
    \ that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means\
    \ you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\
    \ distribute.\n\n   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based\
    \ on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\
    \ facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library,\
    \ provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and\
    \ of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you\
    \ do these two things:\n\n      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy\
    \ of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.\
    \ This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\n\n      b)\
    \ Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it\
    \ is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying\
    \ uncombined form of the same work.\n\n   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense,\
    \ link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this\
    \ License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\
    \ the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this\
    \ License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\
    \ this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties\
    \ remain in full compliance.\n\n   9. You are not required to accept this License,\
    \ since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to\
    \ modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are\
    \ prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying\
    \ or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate\
    \ your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for\
    \ copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\n\n   10.\
    \ Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the\
    \ recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,\
    \ distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions.\
    \ You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\
    \ rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third\
    \ parties to this License.\n\n   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment\
    \ or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to\
    \ patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement\
    \ or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse\
    \ you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\
    \ simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,\
    \ then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example,\
    \ if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library\
    \ by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the\
    \ only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely\
    \ from distribution of the Library.\n\n   If any portion of this section is held\
    \ invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the\
    \ section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply\
    \ in other circumstances.\n\n   It is not the purpose of this section to induce\
    \ you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity\
    \ of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity\
    \ of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license\
    \ practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of\
    \ software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application\
    \ of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\
    \ to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose\
    \ that choice.\n\n   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is\
    \ believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n   12. If the distribution\
    \ and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents\
    \ or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library\
    \ under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation\
    \ excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\
    \ countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation\
    \ as if written in the body of this License.\n\n   13. The Free Software Foundation\
    \ may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library General Public License\
    \ from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present\
    \ version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n \
    \  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies\
    \ a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library\
    \ does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published\
    \ by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   14. If you wish to incorporate parts\
    \ of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible\
    \ with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is\
    \ copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n   NO WARRANTY\n\
    \n   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\
    \ FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE\
    \ WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\
    \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply\
    \ These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\nIf you develop a new library, and you want\
    \ it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it\
    \ free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting\
    \ redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\
    \ ordinary General Public License).\n\nTo apply these terms, attach the following\
    \ notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source\
    \ file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\
    \ have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice\
    \ is found.\n\none line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.\n\
    \nCopyright (C) year name of author\n\nThis library is free software; you can\
    \ redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General\
    \ Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version\
    \ 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis library is\
    \ distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without\
    \ even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\
    \ See the GNU Library General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have\

    \ if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor,\
    \ Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by\
    \ electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work\
    \ as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\"\
    \ for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne,\

    \nCopyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street,\
    \ Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and\
    \ distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not\
    \ allowed.\n\n[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also\
    \ counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\
    \ the version number 2.1.]\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed\
    \ to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General\
    \ Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\
    \ software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\nThis license,\
    \ the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software\
    \ packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors\
    \ who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully\
    \ about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\
    \ strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n\
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.\
    \ Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom\
    \ to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish);\
    \ that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change\
    \ the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed\
    \ that you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions\
    \ that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender\
    \ these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you\
    \ if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\nFor example,\
    \ if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must\
    \ give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that\
    \ they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the\
    \ library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they\
    \ can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\
    \ it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect\
    \ your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we\
    \ offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\
    \ and/or modify the library.\n\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it\
    \ very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library\
    \ is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what\
    \ they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation\
    \ will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\n\nFinally,\
    \ software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program.\
    \ We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of\
    \ a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore,\
    \ we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must\
    \ be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\nMost\
    \ GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General\
    \ Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies\
    \ to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General\
    \ Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit\
    \ linking those libraries into non-free programs.\n\nWhen a program is linked\
    \ with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination\
    \ of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original\
    \ library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking\
    \ only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General\
    \ Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.\n\
    \nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less\
    \ to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also\
    \ provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing\
    \ non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General\
    \ Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages\
    \ in certain special circumstances.\n\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may\
    \ be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library,\
    \ so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must\
    \ be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does\
    \ the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little\
    \ to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser\
    \ General Public License.\n\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library\
    \ in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body\
    \ of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free\
    \ programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as\
    \ well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\n\nAlthough the Lesser\
    \ General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure\
    \ that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and\
    \ the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.\n\
    \nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the\
    \ library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived\
    \ from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order\
    \ to run.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\
    \n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which\
    \ contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying\
    \ it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License\
    \ (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nA\
    \ \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so\
    \ as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those\
    \ functions and data) to form executables.\n\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to\
    \ any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms.\
    \ A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work\
    \ under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion\
    \ of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly\
    \ into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation\
    \ in the term \"modification\".)\n\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred\
    \ form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source\
    \ code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\
    \ interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and\
    \ installation of the library.\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution\
    \ and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.\
    \ The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output\
    \ from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\
    \ on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing\
    \ it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program\
    \ that uses the Library does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies\
    \ of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided\
    \ that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\
    \ copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that\
    \ refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy\
    \ of this License along with the Library.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical\
    \ act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection\
    \ in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library\
    \ or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\
    \ distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided\
    \ that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n     a) The modified work must\
    \ itself be a software library.\n\n     b) You must cause the files modified to\
    \ carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any\
    \ change.\n\n     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\
    \ charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n     d) If a\
    \ facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to\
    \ be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as\
    \ an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith\
    \ effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function\
    \ or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose\
    \ remains meaningful.\n\n(For example, a function in a library to compute square\
    \ roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.\
    \ Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or\
    \ table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply\
    \ it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements\
    \ apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work\
    \ are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent\
    \ and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply\
    \ to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute\
    \ the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the\
    \ distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions\
    \ for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part\
    \ regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to\
    \ claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,\
    \ the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative\
    \ or collective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of\
    \ another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based\
    \ on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring\
    \ the other work under the scope of this License.\n\n3. You may opt to apply the\
    \ terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to\
    \ a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that\
    \ refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public\
    \ License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version\
    \ 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\
    \ that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\n\
    \nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy,\
    \ so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies\
    \ and derivative works made from that copy.\n\nThis option is useful when you\
    \ wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\n\
    \n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,\
    \ under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections\
    \ 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding\
    \ machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\
    \ 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\nIf distribution\
    \ of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then\
    \ offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies\
    \ the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are\
    \ not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n5. A program\
    \ that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to\
    \ work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work\
    \ that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work\
    \ of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\nHowever,\
    \ linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable\
    \ that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library),\
    \ rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered\
    \ by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\
    \nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that\
    \ is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work\
    \ of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially\
    \ significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is\
    \ itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined\
    \ by law.\n\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure\
    \ layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines\
    \ or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless\
    \ of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object\
    \ code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n\nOtherwise,\
    \ if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code\
    \ for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work\
    \ also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the\
    \ Library itself.\n\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine\
    \ or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work\
    \ containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of\
    \ your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the\
    \ customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\
    \nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is\
    \ used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You\
    \ must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright\
    \ notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as\
    \ well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you\
    \ must do one of these things:\n\n     a) Accompany the work with the complete\
    \ corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\
    \ changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and\
    \ 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the\
    \ complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or\
    \ source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce\
    \ a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that\
    \ the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not\
    \ necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\n\
    \n     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.\
    \ A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library\
    \ already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions\
    \ into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of\
    \ the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible\
    \ with the version that the work was made with.\n\n     c) Accompany the work\
    \ with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user\
    \ the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the\
    \ cost of performing this distribution.\n\n     d) If distribution of the work\
    \ is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent\
    \ access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\n\n     e)\
    \ Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that\
    \ you have already sent this user a copy.\n\nFor an executable, the required form\
    \ of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs\
    \ needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,\
    \ the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed\
    \ (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,\
    \ and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that\
    \ component itself accompanies the executable.\n\nIt may happen that this requirement\
    \ contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do\
    \ not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you\
    \ cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\n\
    \n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side\
    \ in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this\
    \ License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate\
    \ distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities\
    \ is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n     a)\
    \ Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,\
    \ uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under\
    \ the terms of the Sections above.\n\n     b) Give prominent notice with the combined\
    \ library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\
    \ where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n8. You may\
    \ not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as\
    \ expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\
    \ sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\
    \ copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\
    \ terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n9. You are\
    \ not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,\
    \ nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its\
    \ derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this\
    \ License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based\
    \ on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\
    \ all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library\
    \ or works based on it.\n\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any\
    \ work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from\
    \ the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject\
    \ to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on\
    \ the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible\
    \ for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n11. If, as a\
    \ consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for\
    \ any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you\
    \ (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions\
    \ of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.\
    \ If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under\
    \ this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\
    \ may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would\
    \ not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive\
    \ copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy\
    \ both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the\
    \ Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable\
    \ under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\
    \ apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\
    \nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents\
    \ or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\
    \ section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\
    \ distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people\
    \ have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through\
    \ that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to\
    \ the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through\
    \ any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is\
    \ intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the\
    \ rest of this License.\n\n12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is\
    \ restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,\
    \ the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may\
    \ add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\
    \ so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.\
    \ In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the\
    \ body of this License.\n\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised\
    \ and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\
    \ Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\
    \ differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given\
    \ a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of\
    \ this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option\
    \ of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later\
    \ version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify\
    \ a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free\
    \ Software Foundation.\n\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library\
    \ into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with\
    \ these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted\
    \ by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\
    \ make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving\
    \ the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the\
    \ sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY\
    \ IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT\
    \ PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\
    \ HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\
    \ OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\
    \ IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\
    \ THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.\
    \ SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\
    \ REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR\
    \ AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\
    \ AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\
    \ INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\
    \ OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO\
    \ LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR\
    \ THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE),\
    \ EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\
    \ DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your\
    \ New Libraries\n\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the\
    \ greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\
    \ everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution\
    \ under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General\
    \ Public License).\n\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the\
    \ library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\
    \ effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\
    \ the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n\
    \     one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.\n     Copyright\
    \ (C) year  name of author\n\n     This library is free software; you can redistribute\
    \ it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License\
    \ as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License,\
    \ or (at your option) any later version.\n\n     This library is distributed in\
    \ the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the\
    \ implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See\
    \ the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n     You should have\

    \ Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA Also add information on how to contact you\
    \ by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work\
    \ as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\"\
    \ for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne,\

    \nCopyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\n51 Franklin Street,\
    \ Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and\
    \ distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not\
    \ allowed.\n\n[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts\
    \ as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version\
    \ number 2.1.]\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take\
    \ away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public\
    \ Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\
    \ make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\nThis license, the Lesser\
    \ General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically\
    \ libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use\
    \ it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\
    \ this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to\
    \ use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\nWhen we speak\
    \ of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General\
    \ Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute\
    \ copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you\
    \ receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software\
    \ and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you\
    \ can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions\
    \ that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender\
    \ these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you\
    \ if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\nFor example,\
    \ if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must\
    \ give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that\
    \ they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the\
    \ library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they\
    \ can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\
    \ it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect\
    \ your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we\
    \ offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\
    \ and/or modify the library.\n\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it\
    \ very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library\
    \ is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what\
    \ they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation\
    \ will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\n\nFinally,\
    \ software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program.\
    \ We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of\
    \ a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore,\
    \ we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must\
    \ be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\nMost\
    \ GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General\
    \ Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies\
    \ to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General\
    \ Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit\
    \ linking those libraries into non-free programs.\n\nWhen a program is linked\
    \ with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination\
    \ of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original\
    \ library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking\
    \ only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General\
    \ Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.\n\
    \nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less\
    \ to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also\
    \ provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing\
    \ non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General\
    \ Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages\
    \ in certain special circumstances.\n\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may\
    \ be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library,\
    \ so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must\
    \ be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does\
    \ the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little\
    \ to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser\
    \ General Public License.\n\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library\
    \ in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body\
    \ of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free\
    \ programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as\
    \ well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\n\nAlthough the Lesser\
    \ General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure\
    \ that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and\
    \ the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.\n\
    \nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the\
    \ library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived\
    \ from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order\
    \ to run.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\
    \n   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program\
    \ which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party\
    \ saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License\
    \ (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n \
    \  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared\
    \ so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of\
    \ those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n   The \"Library\", below,\
    \ refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under\
    \ these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any\
    \ derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library\
    \ or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\
    \ straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included\
    \ without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n   \"Source code\" for\
    \ a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.\
    \ For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules\
    \ it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts\
    \ used to control compilation and installation of the library.\n\n   Activities\
    \ other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License;\
    \ they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is\
    \ not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents\
    \ constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library\
    \ in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library\
    \ does and what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n   1. You may copy\
    \ and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you\
    \ receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\
    \ publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;\
    \ keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of\
    \ any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\n\
    \n   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you\
    \ may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n   2.\
    \ You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus\
    \ forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications\
    \ or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all\
    \ of these conditions:\n\n      a) The modified work must itself be a software\
    \ library.\n\n      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\
    \ stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n      c) You\
    \ must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties\
    \ under the terms of this License.\n\n      d) If a facility in the modified Library\
    \ refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program\
    \ that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is\
    \ invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event\
    \ an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates,\
    \ and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n   (For example,\
    \ a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely\
    \ well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires\
    \ that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be\
    \ optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must\
    \ still compute square roots.)\n\n   These requirements apply to the modified\
    \ work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from\
    \ the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works\
    \ in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections\
    \ when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same\
    \ sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution\
    \ of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other\
    \ licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless\
    \ of who wrote it.\n\n   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights\
    \ or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is\
    \ to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective\
    \ works based on the Library.\n\n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work\
    \ not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library)\
    \ on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work\
    \ under the scope of this License.\n\n   3. You may opt to apply the terms of\
    \ the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy\
    \ of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this\
    \ License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version\
    \ 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary\
    \ GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead\
    \ if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\n\n   Once this\
    \ change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary\
    \ GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works\
    \ made from that copy.\n\n   This option is useful when you wish to copy part\
    \ of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n   4. You\
    \ may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under\
    \ Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\
    \ 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\
    \ source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\
    \ on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n   If distribution\
    \ of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then\
    \ offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies\
    \ the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are\
    \ not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n   5. A program\
    \ that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to\
    \ work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work\
    \ that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work\
    \ of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n \
    \  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates\
    \ an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions\
    \ of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable\
    \ is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution\
    \ of such executables.\n\n   When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material\
    \ from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work\
    \ may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\
    \ Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without\
    \ the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be\
    \ true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n   If such an object file uses only\
    \ numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros\
    \ and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the\
    \ object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\
    \ work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library\
    \ will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative\
    \ of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms\
    \ of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\
    \ whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n   6. As\
    \ an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that\
    \ uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of\
    \ the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that\
    \ the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\
    \ engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n   You must give prominent\
    \ notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the\
    \ Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this\
    \ License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include\
    \ the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing\
    \ the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\n\
    \n      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable\
    \ source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work\
    \ (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is\
    \ an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"\
    work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user\
    \ can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing\
    \ the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents\
    \ of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile\
    \ the application to use the modified definitions.)\n\n      b) Use a suitable\
    \ shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism\
    \ is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the\
    \ user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable,\
    \ and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the\
    \ user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with\
    \ the version that the work was made with.\n\n      c) Accompany the work with\
    \ a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials\
    \ specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing\
    \ this distribution.\n\n      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering\
    \ access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the\
    \ above specified materials from the same place.\n\n      e) Verify that the user\
    \ has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent\
    \ this user a copy.\n\n   For an executable, the required form of the \"work that\
    \ uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing\
    \ the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be\
    \ distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either\
    \ source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)\
    \ of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\
    \ itself accompanies the executable.\n\n   It may happen that this requirement\
    \ contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do\
    \ not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you\
    \ cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\n\
    \n   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library\
    \ side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not\
    \ covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that\
    \ the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other\
    \ library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two\
    \ things:\n\n      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\
    \ based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must\
    \ be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\n\n      b) Give prominent\
    \ notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based\
    \ on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form\
    \ of the same work.\n\n   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with,\
    \ or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any\
    \ attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the\
    \ Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\
    \ However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License\
    \ will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full\
    \ compliance.\n\n   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you\
    \ have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\
    \ distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited\
    \ by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing\
    \ the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance\
    \ of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing\
    \ or modifying the Library or works based on it.\n\n   10. Each time you redistribute\
    \ the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically\
    \ receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with\
    \ or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose\
    \ any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\
    \ You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this\
    \ License.\n\n   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of\
    \ patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\
    \ conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)\
    \ that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from\
    \ the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously\
    \ your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then\
    \ as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if\
    \ a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library\
    \ by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the\
    \ only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely\
    \ from distribution of the Library.\n\n   If any portion of this section is held\
    \ invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the\
    \ section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply\
    \ in other circumstances.\n\n   It is not the purpose of this section to induce\
    \ you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity\
    \ of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity\
    \ of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license\
    \ practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of\
    \ software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application\
    \ of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\
    \ to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose\
    \ that choice.\n\n   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is\
    \ believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n   12. If the distribution\
    \ and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents\
    \ or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library\
    \ under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation\
    \ excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\
    \ countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation\
    \ as if written in the body of this License.\n\n   13. The Free Software Foundation\
    \ may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License\
    \ from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present\
    \ version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n \
    \  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies\
    \ a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library\
    \ does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published\
    \ by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   14. If you wish to incorporate parts\
    \ of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible\
    \ with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is\
    \ copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n   NO WARRANTY\n\
    \n   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\
    \ FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE\
    \ WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\
    \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply\
    \ These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\nIf you develop a new library, and you want\
    \ it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it\
    \ free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting\
    \ redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\
    \ ordinary General Public License).\n\nTo apply these terms, attach the following\
    \ notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source\
    \ file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\
    \ have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice\
    \ is found.\n\n<one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.>\n\
    \nCopyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n\nThis library is free software; you\
    \ can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General\
    \ Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version\
    \ 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis library is\
    \ distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without\
    \ even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\

    \ by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work\
    \ as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\"\
