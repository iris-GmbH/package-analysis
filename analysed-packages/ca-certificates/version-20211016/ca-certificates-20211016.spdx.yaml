    \ (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor,\
    \ Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim\
    \ copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\
    \nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share\
    \ and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee\
    \ your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is\
    \ free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free\
    \ Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit\
    \ to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the\
    \ GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs,\
    \ too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\
    \ Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom\
    \ to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\
    \ that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\
    \ the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you\
    \ can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions\
    \ that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\
    \ These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute\
    \ copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute\
    \ copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients\
    \ all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or\
    \ can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their\
    \ rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,\
    \ and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\
    \ and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours,\
    \ we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty\
    \ for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed\
    \ on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,\
    \ so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'\
    \ reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\
    \ patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\
    \ individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.\
    \ To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for\
    \ everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions\
    \ for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR\
    \ COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n   0. This License applies to any\
    \ program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder\
    \ saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.\
    \ The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based\
    \ on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright\
    \ law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\
    \ verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,\
    \ translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each\
    \ licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n   Activities other than copying, distribution\
    \ and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.\
    \ The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\
    \ is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent\
    \ of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on\
    \ what the Program does.\n\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies\
    \ of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\
    \ you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\
    \ this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients\
    \ of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n   You may\
    \ charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your\
    \ option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n   2. You may modify\
    \ your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work\
    \ based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under\
    \ the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\
    \n      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\
    \ that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n      b) You must\
    \ cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains\
    \ or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole\
    \ at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n     \
    \ c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you\
    \ must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary\
    \ way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright\
    \ notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\
    \ a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions,\
    \ and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the\
    \ Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,\
    \ your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\n\
    \   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\
    \ sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\
    \ considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,\
    \ and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\
    \ works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is\
    \ a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\
    \ of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\
    \ whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\n   Thus,\
    \ it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights\
    \ to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right\
    \ to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\n\
    \n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with\
    \ the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\
    \ distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n\
    \n   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\
    \ Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\
    \ 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n      a) Accompany\
    \ it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must\
    \ be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily\
    \ used for software interchange; or,\n\n      b) Accompany it with a written offer,\
    \ valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more\
    \ than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable\
    \ copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\
    \ Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;\
    \ or,\n\n      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\
    \ to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for\
    \ noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code\
    \ or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\
    \n   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\
    \ modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all\
    \ the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition\
    \ files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the\
    \ executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need\
    \ not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\
    \ form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating\
    \ system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\
    \ the executable.\n\n   If distribution of executable or object code is made by\
    \ offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access\
    \ to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source\
    \ code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with\
    \ the object code.\n\n   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute\
    \ the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\
    \ to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\
    \ copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\
    \ terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n   5. You are\
    \ not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,\
    \ nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its\
    \ derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this\
    \ License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based\
    \ on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\
    \ all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ or works based on it.\n\n   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any\
    \ work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from\
    \ the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\
    \ terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\
    \ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\
    \ compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n   7. If, as a consequence of\
    \ a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason\
    \ (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
    \ order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
    \ they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\
    \ so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\
    \ other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\
    \ Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\
    \ redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly\
    \ through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\
    \ be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\n   If any portion\
    \ of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,\
    \ the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is\
    \ intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\n   It is not the purpose of this\
    \ section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims\
    \ or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose\
    \ of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which\
    \ is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions\
    \ to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on\
    \ consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide\
    \ if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and\
    \ a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\n   This section is intended to make\
    \ thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\
    \n   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\
    \ countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright\
    \ holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical\
    \ distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted\
    \ only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\
    \ the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n   9. The Free\
    \ Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public\
    \ License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the\
    \ present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\
    \n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies\
    \ a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\
    \ does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version\
    \ ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n   10. If you wish to incorporate\
    \ parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions\
    \ are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which\
    \ is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n   NO WARRANTY\n\
    \n   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\
    \ FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE\
    \ WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED\
    \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply\
    \ These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want\
    \ it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve\
    \ this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change\
    \ under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.\
    \ It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\
    \ convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"\
    copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n<one line\
    \ to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.>\n\nCopyright (C) <yyyy>\
    \ <name of author>\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\
    \ modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\
    \ the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)\
    \ any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be\
    \ useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY\
    \ or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for\
    \ more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\
    \ along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\
    \ 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.\n\nAlso add information\
    \ on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive,\
    \ make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\
    \nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes\
    \ with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software,\
    \ and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show\
    \ c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show\
    \ the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands\
    \ you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could\
    \ even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should\
    \ also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any,\
    \ to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here is a\
    \ sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest\
    \ in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James\

    2. License Grants and Conditions


    2.1. Grants

    Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:


    (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable
    by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform,
    distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis,
    with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and


    (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale,
    have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor
    Version.


    2.2. Effective Date

    The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective
    for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.


    2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

    The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
    License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
    or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b)
    above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:


    (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or


    (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party''s modifications
    of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software
    (except as part of its Contributor Version); or


    (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.


    This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos
    of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements
    in Section 3.4).


    2.4. Subsequent Licenses

    No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute
    the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2)
    or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section
    3.3).


    2.5. Representation

    Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are
    its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its
    Contributions conveyed by this License.


    2.6. Fair Use

    This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright
    doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.


    2.7. Conditions

    Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section
    2.1.


    3. Responsibilities


    3.1. Distribution of Source Form

    All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications
    that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License.
    You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is
    governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this
    License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients'' rights in the
    Source Code Form.


    3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

    If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:


    (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as
    described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form
    how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely
    manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and


    (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or
    sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable
    Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients'' rights in the Source
    Code Form under this License.


    3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

    You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided
    that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software.
    If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by
    one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With
    Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered
    Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
    the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software
    under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).


    3.4. Notices

    You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright
    notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability)
    contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You
    may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.


    3.5. Application of Additional Terms

    You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
    or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However,
    You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You
    must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability
    obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor
    for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers
    of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.


    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with
    respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order,
    or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
    maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect.
    Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions
    of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by
    statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient
    of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.


    5. Termination


    5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
    fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the
    rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated
    (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates
    Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify
    You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You
    have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor
    are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance
    by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance
    with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30
    days after Your receipt of the notice.


    5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement
    claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims)
    alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent,
    then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software
    under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.


    5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
    license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly
    granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall
    survive termination.


    6. Disclaimer of Warranty

    Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without warranty
    of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation,
    warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for
    a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and
    performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove
    defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary
    servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential
    part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this
    License except under this disclaimer.


    7. Limitation of Liability

    Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence),
    contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered
    Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation,
    damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
    malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party
    shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of
    liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting
    from such party''s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
    Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
    damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.


    8. Litigation

    Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
    jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and
    such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference
    to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party''s
    ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.


    9. Miscellaneous

    This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof.
    If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall
    be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation
    which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
    drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.


    10. Versions of the License


    10.1. New Versions

    Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3,
    no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions
    of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.


    10.2. Effect of New Versions

    You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the
    License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the
    terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.


    10.3. Modified Versions

    If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a
    new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this
    License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the
    license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).


    10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses

    If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
    Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described
    in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.


    Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

    \ by Initial Developer, to make, have made, use and sell (``Utilize'') the Original\
    \ Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is\
    \ reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize \tthe Original Code (or portions\
    \ thereof) and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further\
    \ Modifications or combinations.\n\n     2.2. Contributor Grant.\nEach Contributor\
    \ hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject\
    \ to third party intellectual property claims:\n\n          (a) to use, reproduce,\
    \ modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created\
    \ by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with\
    \ other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and\n\n  \
    \        (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor,\
    \ to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the\
    \ extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize\
    \ the Contributor Version (or portions \tthereof), and not to any greater extent\
    \ that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.\n\n\
    3. Distribution Obligations.\n\n     3.1. Application of License.\n     The Modifications\
    \ which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this\
    \ License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of\
    \ Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future\
    \ version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy\
    \ of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not\
    \ offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts\
    \ the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.\
    \ However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights\
    \ described in Section 3.5.\n\n     3.2. Availability of Source Code.\n     Any\
    \ Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available\
    \ in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media\
    \ as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism\
    \ to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available\
    \ via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve\
    \ (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)\
    \ months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made\
    \ available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source\
    \ Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism\
    \ is maintained by a third party.\n\n     3.3. Description of Modifications.\n\
    \     You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file\
    \ documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of\
    \ any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is\
    \ derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial\
    \ Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source\
    \ Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation\
    \ in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n     3.4.\
    \ Intellectual Property Matters\n\n          (a) Third Party Claims.\n       \
    \   If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in\
    \ particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you\
    \ must include a text file with the source code distribution titled ``LEGAL''\
    \ which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail\
    \ that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after\
    \ You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall\
    \ promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and\
    \ shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\
    \ reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new\
    \ knowledge has been obtained.\n\n          (b) Contributor APIs.\n          If\
    \ Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control\
    \ patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also\
    \ include this information in the LEGAL file.\n\n     3.5. Required Notices.\n\
    \     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code,\
    \ and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe\
    \ recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s),\
    \ You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.\
    \ If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due\
    \ to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a\
    \ relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.\
    \ You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity\
    \ or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However,\
    \ You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer\
    \ or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,\
    \ support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You\
    \ hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\
    \ liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result\
    \ of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n     3.6. Distribution\
    \ of Executable Versions.\n     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable\
    \ form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered\
    \ Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the\
    \ Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description\
    \ of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice\
    \ must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related\
    \ documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating\
    \ to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code\
    \ under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this\
    \ License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License\
    \ and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or\
    \ alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set\
    \ forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\
    \ license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this\
    \ License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor.\
    \ You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for\
    \ any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result\
    \ of any such terms You offer.\n\n     3.7. Larger Works.\n     You may create\
    \ a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the\
    \ terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In\
    \ such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled\
    \ for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\
    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with\
    \ respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then\
    \ You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible;\
    \ and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\
    \ must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included\
    \ with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by\
    \ statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\
    \ recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Application of\
    \ this License.\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\
    \ attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions\
    \ of the License.\n\n     6.1. New Versions.\n     Netscape Communications Corporation\
    \ (``Netscape'') may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time\
    \ to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n\n   \
    \  6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n     Once Covered Code has been published under\
    \ a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under\
    \ the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under\
    \ the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No\
    \ one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered\
    \ Code created under this License.\n\n     6.3. Derivative Works.\n     If you\
    \ create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order\
    \ to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License),\
    \ you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Mozilla'', ``MOZILLAPL'',\
    \ ``MOZPL'', ``Netscape'', ``NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear\
    \ anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of\
    \ the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and\
    \ Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original\
    \ Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves\
    \ be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\
    COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY\
    \ OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES\
    \ THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR\
    \ PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE\
    \ OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN\
    \ ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME\
    \ THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF\
    \ WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED\
    \ CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. TERMINATION.\n\
    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if\
    \ You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30\
    \ days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which\
    \ are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions\
    \ which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this\
    \ License shall survive.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES\
    \ AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR\
    \ OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR\
    \ OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR\
    \ ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\
    \ OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\
    \ WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL\
    \ DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY\
    \ OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR\
    \ DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT\
    \ APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\
    \ EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION\
    \ AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\nThe\
    \ Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.\
    \ 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software'' and ``commercial\
    \ computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212\
    \ (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through\
    \ 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with\
    \ only those rights set forth herein.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\nThis License represents\
    \ the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of\
    \ this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only\
    \ to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed\
    \ by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides\
    \ otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes\
    \ in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered\
    \ to do business in, the United States of America: (a) unless otherwise agreed\
    \ in writing, all disputes relating to this License (excepting any dispute relating\
    \ to intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding arbitration,\
    \ with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating\
    \ to this Agreement shall be held in Santa Clara County, California, under the\
    \ auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation relating to this Agreement\
    \ shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District\
    \ of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the\
    \ losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs\
    \ and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations\
    \ Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\
    \ Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be\
    \ construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n\n12. RESPONSIBILITY\
    \ FOR CLAIMS.\nExcept in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply\
    \ with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly,\
    \ out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of\
    \ copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing\
    \ such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties\
    \ to distribute responsibility on an equitable basis.\n\nEXHIBIT A.\n\n``The contents\

    License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt\
    \ to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2.\
    \ Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable\
    \ Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source\
    \ Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients\
    \ of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n\
    \    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than\
    \ the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such\
    \ Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under\
    \ different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does\
    \ not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code\
    \ Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create\
    \ and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You\
    \ also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software.\
    \ If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed\
    \ by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible\
    \ With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute\
    \ such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that\
    \ the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the\
    \ Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n\
    License(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any\
    \ license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of\
    \ warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form\
    \ of\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\n\
    the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application\
    \ of Additional Terms\n\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,\
    \ support,\nindemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n\
    Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of\
    \ any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty,\
    \ support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You\
    \ hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such\
    \ Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms\
    \ You offer. You may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations\
    \ of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to\
    \ Statute or Regulation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\
    \nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense\
    \ with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\nstatute, judicial\
    \ order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License\
    \ to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code\
    \ they affect. Such description must\nbe placed in a text file included with all\
    \ distributions of the Covered\nSoftware under this License. Except to the extent\
    \ prohibited by statute\nor regulation, such description must be sufficiently\
    \ detailed for a\nrecipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n\
    5. Termination\n--------------\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will\
    \ terminate automatically\nif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However,\
    \ if You become\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a\
    \ particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\n\
    Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\nongoing\
    \ basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance by some\
    \ reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance.\
    \ Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing\
    \ basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable\
    \ means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with\
    \ this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days\
    \ after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against\
    \ any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory\
    \ judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor\
    \ Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted\
    \ to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n\
    2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under\
    \ Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors\
    \ and resellers) which\nhave been validly granted by You or Your distributors\
    \ under this License\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n************************************************************************\n\

- extractedText: " GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 2, June 1991\n\nCopyright (C)\
    \ 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor,\
    \ Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute\
    \ verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\
    Preamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom\
    \ to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended\
    \ to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\
    \ software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most\
    \ of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors\
    \ commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered\
    \ by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your\
    \ programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,\
    \ not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have\
    \ the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service\
    \ if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that\
    \ you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that\
    \ you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make\
    \ restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender\
    \ the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you\
    \ if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example,\
    \ if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you\
    \ must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that\
    \ they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these\
    \ terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1)\
    \ copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\
    \ permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each\
    \ author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands\
    \ that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified\
    \ by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they\
    \ have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not\
    \ reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is\
    \ threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that\
    \ redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in\
    \ effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear\
    \ that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at\
    \ all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\
    \ follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\
    \n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\
    \ placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms\
    \ of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program\
    \ or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\
    \ derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program\
    \ or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\
    \ into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation\
    \ in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities\
    \ other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License;\
    \ they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted,\
    \ and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a\
    \ work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\
    \ Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and\
    \ distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in\
    \ any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each\
    \ copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\
    \ all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\
    \ and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with\
    \ the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a\
    \ copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\
    \ fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\
    \ of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such\
    \ modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you\
    \ also meet all of these conditions:\n\n     a) You must cause the modified files\
    \ to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of\
    \ any change.\n\n     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,\
    \ that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\
    \ thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the\
    \ terms of this License.\n\n     c) If the modified program normally reads commands\
    \ interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive\
    \ use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including\
    \ an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else,\
    \ saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program\
    \ under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\
    \ (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print\
    \ such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print\
    \ an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.\
    \ If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\
    \ can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then\
    \ this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute\
    \ them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of\
    \ a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole\
    \ must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees\
    \ extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who\
    \ wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\
    \ your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise\
    \ the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based\
    \ on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on\
    \ the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume\
    \ of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\
    \ scope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work\
    \ based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms\
    \ of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n\
    \     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\
    \ code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on\
    \ a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n     b) Accompany\
    \ it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party,\
    \ for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution,\
    \ a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed\
    \ under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\
    \ interchange; or,\n\n     c) Accompany it with the information you received as\
    \ to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\
    \ only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\
    \ object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection\
    \ b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work\
    \ for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\
    \ means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\
    \ definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\
    \ of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed\
    \ need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or\
    \ binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\
    \ operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself\
    \ accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code\
    \ is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\
    \ access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of\
    \ the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\
    \ along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute\
    \ the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\
    \ to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically\
    \ terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\
    \ copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\
    \ terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are\
    \ not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,\
    \ nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its\
    \ derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this\
    \ License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based\
    \ on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\
    \ all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program\
    \ or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work\
    \ based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\
    \ original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these\
    \ terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\
    \ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\
    \ compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a\
    \ court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason\
    \ (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court\
    \ order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,\
    \ they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\
    \ so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\
    \ other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\
    \ Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\
    \ redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly\
    \ through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\
    \ be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of\
    \ this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,\
    \ the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is\
    \ intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section\
    \ to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest\
    \ validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting\
    \ the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\
    \ by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to\
    \ the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent\
    \ application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or\
    \ she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee\
    \ cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear\
    \ what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the\
    \ distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either\
    \ by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places\
    \ the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution\
    \ limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only\
    \ in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates\
    \ the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software\
    \ Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License\
    \ from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present\
    \ version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach\
    \ version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a\
    \ version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\"\
    , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\
    \ or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\
    \ does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version\
    \ ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate\
    \ parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions\
    \ are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which\
    \ is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;\
    \ we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two\
    \ goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software\
    \ and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\
    \n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\
    \ THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\
    \ STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM\
    \ \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\
    \ BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\
    \ A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\
    \ PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST\
    \ OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS\
    \ REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,\
    \ OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED\
    \ ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL\
    \ OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\
    \ (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\
    \ OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE\

    \ OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to\
    \ Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and\
    \ you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to\
    \ achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and\
    \ change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.\
    \ It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\
    \ convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"\
    copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n     one\
    \ line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does. Copyright (C) yyyy\
    \ name of author\n\n     This program is free software; you can redistribute it\
    \ and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published\
    \ by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your\
    \ option) any later version.\n\n     This program is distributed in the hope that\
    \ it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty\
    \ of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General\
    \ Public License for more details.\n\n     You should have received a copy of\
    \ the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the\
    \ Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA\
    \ 02110-1301, USA. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and\
    \ paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice\
    \ like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n     Gnomovision version\
    \ 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY;\
    \ for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute\
    \ it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical\
    \ commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General\
    \ Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other\
    \ than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever\
    \ suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)\
    \ or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program,\
    \ if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby\
    \ disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes\
    \ at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\
