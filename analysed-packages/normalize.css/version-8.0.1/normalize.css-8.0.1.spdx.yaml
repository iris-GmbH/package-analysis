    \ form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source\

    \ whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated\
    \ by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example\
    \ is provided in the Appendix below).\n\n\"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work,\
    \ whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work\
    \ and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\
    \ represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this\
    \ License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from,\
    \ or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative\
    \ Works thereof.\n\n\"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\

    \ hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,\
    \ irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly\
    \ display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative\
    \ Works in Source or Object form.\n\n3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the\
    \ terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You\
    \ a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\
    \ (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer\
    \ to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies\
    \ only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily\
    \ infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\
    \ with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute\
    \ patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim\
    \ in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the\
    \ Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent\
    \ licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as\
    \ of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce\
    \ and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium,\
    \ with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\
    \ meet the following conditions:\n\n     (a) You must give any other recipients\
    \ of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n     (b) You\
    \ must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed\
    \ the files; and\n\n     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative\
    \ Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution\
    \ notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not\
    \ pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\n\n     (d) If the Work includes\
    \ a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works\
    \ that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices\
    \ contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain\
    \ to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places:\
    \ within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within\
    \ the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works;\
    \ or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such\
    \ third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for\
    \ informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your\
    \ own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\
    \ or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional\
    \ attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.\n\n     You\
    \ may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional\
    \ or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution\
    \ of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided\
    \ Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\
    \ the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless\
    \ You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for\
    \ inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions\
    \ of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding\
    \ the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate\
    \ license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\
    \n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,\
    \ trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required\
    \ for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing\
    \ the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required\
    \ by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\
    \ Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES\
    \ OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation,\
    \ any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or\
    \ FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining\
    \ the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks\
    \ associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation\
    \ of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including\
    \ negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such\
    \ as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any\
    \ Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\
    \ incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of\
    \ this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not\
    \ limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or\
    \ malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such\
    \ Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting\
    \ Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative\
    \ Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of\
    \ support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent\
    \ with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\
    \ on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other\
    \ Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor\
    \ harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor\
    \ by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND\
    \ OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAPPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your\
